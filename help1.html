<FONT COLOR=FF8888><B>Planetary Levels:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>These levels reflect the productive output of the planet.  The planet's class and type strongly 
affects its levels, except for Education, which is completely dependant on structures.  To maximize production, its 
a good idea to focus on a planet's strength, since production in one resource can be exchanged for the others when needed.  
If you have a planet with an exceptionally high ore level, try focusing on ore production, if its gas, focus on gas.  
Planets with lots of slot space are best for research or parts creation.  Building to fill the market gap is also a 
possibility, but remember that the market is a lot more unpredictable than a planet's proficiency.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=CC99FF><B>Labor:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>A planet's labor force represents its ability to shift its primary objectives from turn to turn.  The 
labor force is stored in structures that support labor, which increases the number of labor each turn until reaching max.  
Almost all structures require a certain amount of labor to operate.  The amount of labor thats available compared to the 
amount needed by the structures is the ratio at which the structures operate (up to %100 max).  For example, if your 
planet's production structures need 20 labor when only 10 is available, their output will be %50 of normal.  Any labor 
left over after filling up the required structures is called the Free labor.  Free labor becomes the planet's construction 
force, and are used to build any structures, vehicles, or ships on the planet's build queue.  
<BR><BR>
It is possible to change the percentage of labor involved with structure operation using the labor command.  In this manner, 
when in need of a larger building force, you can reassign more Free labor at the cost of reduced structure output.  However, 
the planet's power plants labor requirement is seperate from the normal percentage labor, and will always be set at %100 
regardless of the production labor percentage.  So, power output will remain at full unless the labor force is so small that 
it drops below the planet's labor need for just its power plants.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=99DDAA><B>Production:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>The primary purpose of planets is production, but in order to fully take advantage you must build the 
appropriate structures to maximize output.  For ore or gas production, structural management is fairly straightforward, by 
simply building gas and ore production facilities to collect the resources from the planet.  Thier output is determined 
by the planet's ore or gas level multiplied by the number of collection structures.  Parts are generated along the 
same lines, except their output is based on the planet's current educational level for each structure.  Research is generated 
by converting ore, gas, or parts from storage into research points that will add up until the current research is 
completed and becomes a usable technology.  For example, a technology will have a cost in points and a point generation ratio.  
Each point will be made by using the ratio in resources for each point.  Parts and research points cannot be partially 
created, if the resources aren't available to create an entire unit, nothing will be produced (however the labs and 
factories will continue to use the resources anyway, without much foresight to their success).<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFDDAA><B>Energy:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Any structure without an internal power source requires energy to function.  Unlike labor needs, energy 
needs are complete, and unless a structure has full power, it will be completely unproductive.  Power from a planet's 
energy grid is provided for structures in the order in which they are on the slot list.  Once power capacity is reached, any 
remaining structures are unpowered and shown seperately.  Unpowered structures still require labor, and deduct from the 
labor pool.  Which means that unpowered structures are negative balances on the planets labor pool, and should be avoided 
unless the planet has labor to spare and no pressing issues to produce as much as it can.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AAAAFF><B>Storage:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>In addition to creating resources, planets are also the main storage unit for resources.  Almost all 
production structures have space to store, and there are dedicated storage structures that provide a very large storage 
capacity.  All of the planet's production output is placed into its storage space, which can hold ore, gas, or parts as 
needed.  Not all resources have to be in storage.  Resources that are brought to the planet or bought remain as free-units 
until the next turn, in which they are placed into storage until it maxes out at %100.  They are stored outside the 
structures in temporary cargo modules to be used for construction as free-units.  Free-units can only be used for structure 
construction added to the queue.  Internal construction cannot utilize free-units like research points, 
and surface vehicle/ship construction.  At the end of each turn, the free-units on the planet surface will be exposed to 
weathering, and may be partially destroyed by certain types of atmospheres as shown:<BR>
<FONT COLOR=99DDAA><B>Class V:</B> 25% Ore, 50% Gas, 75% Parts destroyed<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AACCDD><B>Class L:</B> 20% Ore, 40% Gas, 60% Parts destroyed<BR>
<FONT COLOR=CCAAFF><B>Class M:</B> 15% Ore, 30% Gas, 45% Parts destroyed<BR>
<FONT COLOR=DDAACC><B>Class H:</B> 10% Ore, 20% Gas, 30% Parts destroyed<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFAAAA><B>Class A:</B> 5% Ore, 10% Gas, 15% Parts destroyed<BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>A planet may only sell the resources that are in storage.  Free-units are not accepted by the market.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFFFFF><B>Starting up (quick start suggestions for beginning planets):</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>-Buy some more resources for your planet.  Maybe 40 ore, 40 gas, 40 parts, using your starting credits.  
You'll need them to start up construction.<BR>
<BR>
-Fill up your construction queue, a few power plants, two or three residential structures, and then whatever production 
structures you intend to focus on with the planet.<BR>
<BR>
-Set your labor production percentage to %0, so your labor puts full effort into construction.  Once your labor pool is 
up to a decent size you can start staffing your structures.<BR>
<BR>
-Don't start investing into more complex economies like parts or research until your planet is positively generating a 
decent stock of ore and gas, or you have enough storage to buy enough resources and manage the conversion process.<BR>
