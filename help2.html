<FONT COLOR=CC99FF><B>The Market:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>The market represents the universal pool of buyers and sellers across space that trade resources, 
components, and even ships and vehicles.  The market directly affects the supply of each resource that it recieves and 
trades.  Each units' base price is determined by its ratio to the rest of the units of the same type.  For example, 
the basic price of parts comes from its ratio to the supply of ore and gas.  The lower its ratio to the whole, the 
higher its base price.<BR>
Each unit has a range of market saturation that determines its need by consumers.  The length of the range is a portion of 
the total supply.  When the market sells enough units it will reach the bottom of that range, in which the market's supply 
of that unit is depleted, it will not sell any more units until the following turn or it purchases more of that unit.  
If it purchases enough units to reach market saturation at the top of the range, it will no longer purchase any more 
units until it sells some or the next turn.  As the supply of the unit varies along this range, its price will also 
shift slightly.  When the next turn crosses, the market resets to a point along that range determined by the amount of 
resources actually used to the amount produced over the course of the preceeding turn.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AAAAFF><B>Production</B><FONT COLOR=BBBBBB><B>-</B><FONT COLOR=FFAAAA><B>Consumption:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Each turn the total production of all resources is measured against its total consumption to 
building structures and components.  A (+) indicates a positive generation of the resource by production facilities, 
and that its initial market price will be higher on the range, and therefore cheaper/unit.  A (-) indicates that 
the resource's consumption by construction needs and component construction is greater than its current rate of 
creation, its initial position on the range will be low, and most expensive.  Although this value does not reflect 
the loss of resources due to atmospheric deterioration, or how much of the generated resources are actually entering 
the market, they do give a general indication of the total supply of a material, and a general prediction of its value 
profile for the future.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFDDAA><B>Credits:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Outside actual resources, components, or structures, the standard unit for trade is the credit.  
Credits provide a monetary supplement to the market, a system of barter that is based on the banks that deal in credits, 
which standardize the notes on Grommes, Soveriegns, and Presses of Tritanium, 3 of the most widely accepted forms 
of currency used.  Although the fluctuation of these currencies could individually alter the value of the credit, they 
are shifted and compensated to maintain a balance and keep the credit stable.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFFFFF><B>Resources</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>The basic units of construction widely traded and stored among the interstellar market.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFAAAA><B>Ore:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Mined from planetary crusts and asteroid fields, ore resources provide the raw metal and basic 
construction material for frames and armor.  Ore resources are stored as beams of processed metal in heavy material 
storage packages.  Metallic ore is resistant to corrosion and weathering as free-units, and can shift in price greatly 
with changes in mean construction.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AAFFAA><B>Gas:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Gas resources span a large variety of different vapors that are recovered from the atmospheres of 
planets.  Gases can range from propulsion fuels to highly specialized construction components, as well as intricate 
parts to different types of refining techniques.  In most cases, these volatile resources are stored in large vapor 
tanks or batteries, which are prone to temperature shifts and radiation that could cause them to puncture.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AAAAFF><B>Parts:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Being the most intricately constructed of building commodities, parts more specifically refer to 
computer systems and small scale commodities that require more complicated processing techniques.  Being too delicate and 
unique to manufacture in the component process, these materials are created in factories and ported to the general market 
in different types of storage cases and bins.  Due to their delicate nature, parts are easily damaged and destroyed, 
and cannot survive most types of adverse conditions.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFFFFF><B>Components</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Materials fabricated from the basics of Ore, Gas, and Parts that form the primary market for 
non-completed material barter.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFCCAA><B>Alloys:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Strengthened composites and alloys used in construction.  Alloys form the basis for building 
metallic frames and armor with light weight and tensile strength.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=CCFFAA><B>Plastics:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Treated hydrocarbon and silicate based materials that form an alternate source of construction 
matter to alloys.  Plastics are used in energy systems where non-conductive materials are needed, in addition to 
refined surfaces that resist corrosion and energy oxidation.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AAFFCC><B>Combustibles:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Processed propellants and explosives used in a vast majority of propulsion systems, warhead yields, 
other armament and chemical combustion systems.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AACCFF><B>Transmitters:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Materials that electrically emit and sense energy.  Transmitters are used mainly for sensor and 
communication equipment, as well as emission grids on shields and energy emitters on weapons.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=CCAAFF><B>Computers:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Printed conductors and circuitry that exist in one way or another in virtually all modern equipment 
in existance.  Computers conduct and electrically process energy signals as forms of internal communication and data 
storage/retrieval.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=FFAACC><B>Processors:</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR=BBBBBB>Manufactured conduits that process and regulate energy, like plasma and electric networks inside a 
structure.  Processors transfer and alter the properties of light and energy to create weapons, sensors, and certain 
types of propulsion in a variety of technology levels.<BR>
